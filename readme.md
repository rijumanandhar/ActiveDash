devices to capture user's movement data. This app also displays progress chart from each workout.

## Android Architecture Component
* UI Controller (activity/fragment)
* ViewModel
* Live Data
* Repository
* Database (Firebase Realtime Database)

Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates  
the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) be it via a  
markup language or GUI code from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model)  
so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. The view model of MVVM is a value  
converter,meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model  
in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the view model is more model  
than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic.The view model may implement a mediator pattern,  
organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.
